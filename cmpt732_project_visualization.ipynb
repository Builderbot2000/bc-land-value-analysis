    "The data presented shows the counts of residential and non-residential property uses in various districts for new projects from the years 2020 to 2024. Here are some key observations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Downtown** consistently has a high count of both residential and non-residential property uses, with non-residential properties steadily increasing over the years.\n",
    "- **Hastings-Sunrise** has shown an increase in residential property use from 91 in 2020 to 106 in 2024, though non-residential property use has fluctuated.\n",
    "- **Kerrisdale** has seen a decline in residential property use, from 52 in 2020 to just 33 in 2024, with non-residential uses remaining relatively low.\n",
    "- **Marpole** shows an increase in non-residential property use, from 21 in 2020 to 13 in 2024, while residential use remained fairly steady.\n",
    "- **Oakridge** and **Riley Park** have seen small declines in both residential and non-residential uses, though Riley Park maintained relatively higher numbers for residential properties.\n",
    "- **Victoria-Fraserview** and **Dunbar-Southlands** consistently show higher residential property use in comparison to non-residential property use.\n",
    "- **Strathcona** and **Killarney** have the lowest non-residential property uses, with Strathcona showing a noticeable dip in residential use by 2024.\n",
    "- **West End** remains balanced with both residential and non-residential uses, but non-residential projects have generally seen a higher increase over the years.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Summary**\n",
    "\n",
    "From 2020 to 2024, there have been noticeable trends in the shift of property types in Vancouver's districts:\n",
    "- **Increased non-residential property use** in areas like Downtown, Fairview, and the West End, with some fluctuations in others such as Hastings-Sunrise.\n",
    "- **Residential property use** has remained relatively stable or slightly decreased in several areas, especially in more established neighborhoods like Kerrisdale and Arbutus Ridge.\n",
    "- **Districts like Downtown and West End** continue to see a high demand for both residential and non-residential projects, with Downtown leading in both categories.\n",
    "- **Kerrisdale, Marpole, and Killarney** show a trend toward lower residential development, possibly indicating a shift in property demand or availability.\n",
    "- Overall, the data reveals a dynamic landscape in property development, where the demand for non-residential properties is consistently rising, while residential demand sees mixed results across districts."

    "Summary\n",
    "=====================================\n",
    "\n",
    "The data presents the correlation between investment and land value for **both** overall properties, **residential** properties, and **non-residential** properties from **2017 to 2024**. The correlation coefficient measures the strength and direction of the relationship between investment and land value, with values closer to +1 indicating a strong positive correlation, values closer to -1 indicating a strong negative correlation, and values near 0 indicating little to no correlation.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Overall Properties (Both):\n",
    "-----------------------------\n",
    "- **2017-2023**: The correlation values fluctuate significantly, with mostly **low or negative correlations** between investment and land value. In particular, correlations drop significantly after 2018, with negative correlations in most years (2019 to 2023). The negative correlations observed during **2020-2022** are likely influenced by the **COVID-19 pandemic**, which caused economic disruption and uncertainty, potentially leading to less predictable investment trends and land value shifts.\n",
    "- **2024**: A **positive correlation of 0.192159** is seen in 2024, which is the highest value in the entire dataset, suggesting that investment and land value have a **moderate positive correlation** this year. The recovery phase post-pandemic may have contributed to more stable market conditions, allowing investment to positively influence land values again.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Residential Properties:\n",
    "-------------------------\n",
    "- **2017-2024**: The correlation values are generally **low or negative** in most years, with several periods showing values near zero. The **only significant positive correlation** occurs in 2019 with a value of **0.092306**, but it quickly returns to negative values in 2020. **COVID-19** likely played a role in these fluctuations, as housing markets were hit by uncertainty and shifting demand patterns during the pandemic. In particular, the **2020-2021** period may have experienced both **volatile demand** for housing (due to lockdowns and work-from-home trends) and **disrupted investment flows**.\n",
    "- **2024**: A **slightly positive correlation of 0.071242** is observed, indicating that in the last year, there is a mild positive relationship between investment and land value in the residential sector. The post-pandemic recovery may have led to a small increase in both residential investment and land values, but overall, this market remains less responsive to investment than other sectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Non-Residential Properties:\n",
    "------------------------------\n",
    "- **2017-2023**: There is some fluctuation in the correlation between investment and land value, with a **strong positive correlation** in **2018** (**0.257353**) and **2023** (**0.146542**), suggesting that investment had a more meaningful impact on land values in these years, especially in **2018**. The **COVID-19 pandemic** likely caused disruptions in the non-residential sector, particularly in 2020 and 2021, with demand for office spaces and retail properties plummeting, which may explain the negative correlations during this period.\n",
    "- **2024**: The non-residential sector shows a strong **positive correlation of 0.193192** in 2024, the highest of any year across all sectors. This suggests a **strong positive relationship** between investment and land value in the non-residential property sector. Post-pandemic, as the economy recovers and businesses adapt to new needs (e.g., hybrid workspaces, retail transformations), investment in non-residential properties may begin to have a more noticeable impact on land values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Insights\n",
    "-------------\n",
    "- **General Trend**: Across all sectors (both, residential, and non-residential), the relationship between investment and land value appears **weak** or **inconsistent**, particularly in the years of the **COVID-19 pandemic** (2020-2022). However, there are some **positive correlations** in 2024, particularly in **non-residential properties**, where investment seems to drive land value more significantly compared to other years.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Sector-specific Trends**:\n",
    "  - **Non-residential properties** show more noticeable fluctuations and some years of **strong positive correlation**, especially in **2018** and **2023**, and a **strong positive correlation in 2024**. This indicates that the non-residential market, which was significantly impacted by the pandemic, may be recovering as businesses re-evaluate their real estate needs in a post-COVID world.\n",
    "  - **Residential properties**, on the other hand, exhibit **weak or negative correlations**, with the **only notable positive correlation** occurring in 2019. The impact of **COVID-19** on the residential sector has been multifaceted, with changes in work-from-home patterns and shifts in demand for suburban housing possibly explaining the lack of a clear, positive trend.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Overall Conclusion**: While 2024 shows **moderate to strong positive correlations** in both overall and non-residential sectors, the trend over the years has been **inconsistent**, with some years showing negative or near-zero correlations. The **COVID-19 pandemic** likely played a significant role in disrupting these trends, and the post-pandemic recovery phase in 2024 appears to be stabilizing the relationship between investment and land value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Possible Factors\n",
    "----------------\n",
    "- **COVID-19** had a profound effect on both residential and non-residential markets, particularly during the initial lockdown phases. Economic disruption, changing work patterns, shifting demand, and uncertainty about future market conditions likely led to **volatile investment behaviors** and **land value fluctuations**.\n",
    "- Other factors, including economic conditions, supply-demand dynamics, government policies, and broader real estate market trends, may also explain the relationship between investment and land value during this period.\n",
    "\n",
    "Final Conclusion\n",
    "-----------------\n",
    "The data shows **mixed trends** in the relationship between investment and land value across different sectors and years, with some positive correlations emerging in **2024**, especially in the **non-residential sector**. However, these correlations are far from consistent or strong, and the influence of **COVID-19** appears to have been a significant factor in the observed volatility, suggesting that other external factors beyond investment were heavily influencing land values during the pandemic period.\n"
